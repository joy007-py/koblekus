          I had a problem connecting my data to Redshift. Seemed so simple however having tried numerous people including the AWS paid support we could not get to the bottom of the issue. Finally this team helped me giving me clear instructions on what went wrong with diagrams and phone calls. Very pleased with their support.

Besides our asked, they went above and beyond and helped us educate using AWS benefits, considerations and best practices. Overall very satisfied with their services, we will certainly work with them again on future projects.
